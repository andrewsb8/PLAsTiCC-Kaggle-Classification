This directory of this repository holds the code and data involved in the PLAsTiCC LSST data classification competition.  This will also be used as a submission for the final project for the Big Data course offered at Drexel University in the Physics department.

Details about the competition can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018

Sadly, most of the data files are too large to be stored on GitHub but can be found via the above link!
